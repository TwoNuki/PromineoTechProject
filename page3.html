                <h2>Sumo Lifestyle</h2>
                <p>Sumo wrestlers actually live a fairly tough lifestyle. Aside from living in the stable most of the time, they also have rigorous daily training routines. They also make and eat a lot of very high-calorie food so they can pack on the weight needed for their profession and stay healthy, similar to a strongman.</p>

                <h2>Sumo Food</h2>
                 <p>The thing that sumo wrestlers eat the most, and is also the most well known among sumo fans is a stew called "Chankonabe". This stew is made in a similar style to hot pot, and is full of vegetables and healthy proteins so that sumo wrestlers can not only put on weight, but stay healthy in the process. Meats used are usually chicken or fish, while avoiding things like beef or pork; not only for health purposes but also superstitions, because in sumo, if any part of your body besides the bottoms of your feet touch the ground, you lose. Chicken is an animal that walks on two legs, so it's supposed to bring good luck.</p>

                <h2>Sumo Exercise</h2>
                <p>In addition to eating a lot of food, sumo wrestlers also do a lot of tough exercises in order to stay strong. Some of the more known ones involve Shiko (stomping), squats, weight training, stretches, and stamina exercises.</p>
