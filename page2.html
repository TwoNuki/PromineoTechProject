                <h2>What are Sumotori?</h2>
                <p>Sumo wrestlers have a couple of different official titles they go by. Aside from their rank, they are mostly known as "rikishi" or "sumotori" to refer to a sumo wrestler. Both terms are able to be used interchangably.</p>

                <h2>Where do Sumotori live?</h2>
                <p>Sumotori, especially in the lower ranks, live in a large group house, known as a "stable" or "heya", to train under their coaches or stablemasters. Here they eat, sleep, and train in-between tournaments.</p>
